# UseCaseDerivationTool
This project aims to implement machine learning to determine if a requirement is a valid use case or not. 
It does so by opening a simplified list of requirements and building a feature vector. 
The feature vector needs to be edited manually to generate training data which will be used by WEKA to generate a machine learning model. 
This model can then be used to determine if a requirement is a use case or not.
Requirements that are use cases are then extracted and shown to the user.
